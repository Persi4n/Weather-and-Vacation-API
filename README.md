Project 1: Weather Data Visualization
Overview
This project involves creating visualizations of weather data from over 500 cities around the world. The data is obtained using the OpenWeatherMap API and analyzed to showcase the relationships between various weather variables and latitude.

Project Components
Data Retrieval: Using the citipy library, random geographic coordinates are generated, and the nearest city to each coordinate is identified. Weather data for these cities is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Analysis: The retrieved weather data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame, and scatter plots are created to visualize the relationships between weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed) and latitude.

Linear Regression: Linear regression analysis is performed for each relationship. Separate plots are generated for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with regression lines and model formulas displayed.

Project Files
WeatherPy.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and steps.
output_data/: Folder containing CSV files with retrieved city weather data and generated scatter plot images.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Matplotlib
Pandas
NumPy
Requests
SciPy
citipy
Usage
Run the WeatherPy.ipynb notebook to generate scatter plots and linear regression analyses.
The generated scatter plot images are saved in the output_data/ folder.
Results
The scatter plots and linear regression analyses provide insights into the relationships between weather variables and latitude. These visualizations highlight the impact of latitude on temperature while illustrating the complexity of other weather variables' relationships.

Project 2: Image Classifier Web App
Overview
This project involves building and deploying an image classifier web app using Flask. The app can classify images into categories using a pre-trained deep learning model.

Project Components
Model Training: A deep learning model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) is trained on a dataset of categorized images.

Web App Development: A Flask web app is developed, allowing users to upload their images. The uploaded image is passed to the trained model for classification.

Deployment: The web app is deployed on a web server to make it accessible to users.

Project Files
app.py: Python script containing the Flask web app code.
templates/: Folder containing HTML templates for the web app.
static/: Folder containing static files (CSS, images) for the web app.
model/: Folder containing the pre-trained model file (e.g., .h5 file).
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Flask
TensorFlow (or other deep learning framework)
HTML/CSS
Usage
Place the trained model file in the model/ folder.
Run the app.py script to start the Flask web app.
Access the web app through a web browser and upload an image for classification.
